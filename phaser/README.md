## Capacitor + Phaser

Use this starter to build mobile games using Capacitor and [Phaser](https://phaser.io).  This starter uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with TypeScript which is a great stack for building apps.

Capacitor and Phaser form the basis of such popular games as [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/) üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

After cloning, install dependencies and start the dev server, which by default runs on port `5173` because of Vite (see `node_modules/vite/dist/node/constants.js:const DEFAULT_DEV_PORT = 5173`)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
